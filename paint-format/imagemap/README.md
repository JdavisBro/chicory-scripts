# Chicory Image to Map!
This is a script that turns an image into a save file that shows said image in the map!!!

## How do I

ok ok oko ko kok 

you need python 3.6+, so get that

then install pillow and colorthief with

```py -m pip install pillow colorthief```

(use python3 if you're on mac or linux)

ok now open yer terminal or cmd and navigate to the imagemap folder (oh yeah you'll need to download the whole repository)

now put your image in the imagemap folder and do

```py imagemap.py FILENAME```

and it'll spit out a _playdata

BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILE

close the game if it's running

then move the playdata to `%localappdata%/paintdog/save/_playdata`

ok now run the game and you should be able to check map :))) awesome: )) )

## how

ok so it takes your image and gets the most important 8 colours, then converts it to be only them.

then it makes it into chicory paint data  ands tuff idk you figure it out
