0 = base ground -- DARK GREEN
1 = ramp -- YELLOW
2 = non climable wall -- DARK BROWN
3 = climbable wall -- PINK
4 = sky/see through wall -- GREY
5 = "prop" wall (non walkable ground) -- BRIGHT RED
6 = water -- DARK BLUE
7 = ?? (could not find it)
8 = grub(most) and underground rooms with gifts top layer?? layer 9? -- less dark green
9 = ?? layer 8? (could not find it) -- less dark blue
a = cave and tent top layer OR layer 7 -- less dark blue
b = layer 6 ground -- dark blue
c = layer 5 ground -- less dark green 
d = layer 4 ground -- less dark green
e = layer 3 ground -- less dark green
f = layer 2 ground -- less dark green than base?

ground typing??

the pixel before one of the above will be a ground type, those are

0 = anything that isn't a layer

f = other layer

same color maps apply

-- figure out what 7 and 9 are (probably more layers, check if you can jump from them to lower and to them from lower)
-- figure out exacts on 8 and a, are they just more layers? or are they specific to those areas

color code mappings:

0 = #062100
1 = #fcff42
2 = #543800
3 = #ff94f4
4 = #b5b5b5
5 = #FF0000
6 = #005f85
